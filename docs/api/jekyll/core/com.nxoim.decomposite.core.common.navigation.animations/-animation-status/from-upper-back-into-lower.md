# fromUpperBackIntoLower



[common]\
val [fromUpperBackIntoLower](from-upper-back-into-lower.html): [Boolean](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-boolean/index.html)



This is true when this item is going from a position in the back to another position in the back that is closer to the bottom, e.g. from 1 to 2 (0 being the top of the stack).



Example: addition of an item to the stack when this item was (and will still be) in the back.
