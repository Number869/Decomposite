# fromLowerBackIntoUpper



[common]\
val [fromLowerBackIntoUpper](from-lower-back-into-upper.html): [Boolean](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-boolean/index.html)



This is true when this item is going from a position in the back to another position in the back that is closer to the top, e.g. from 2 to 1 (0 being the top of the stack).



Example: removal of an item from the stack while this item was (and will still be) in the back.
